# OPC-UA Stack

A high-performance and open-source OPC-UA stack implementation.

Note: this is just a *stack* implementation (channels, serialization, structures, security). If you're looking to build a client or server, try the [OPC-UA SDK](https://github.com/digitalpetri/opc-ua-sdk).

Running the Example
--------
Certificate validation is implemented in the server stack and so upon running the ClientServerExample for the first time you'll probably see a stack trace containing this exception:

```java
Caused by: com.digitalpetri.opcua.stack.core.UaException: security checks failed
	at UaTcpClientAcknowledgeHandler.onError(UaTcpClientAcknowledgeHandler.java:162)
	at UaTcpClientAcknowledgeHandler.decode(UaTcpClientAcknowledgeHandler.java:89)
```

You'll now find a "security" folder in whatever you've configured your working directory as when running the example. Inside that folder, you should find "rejected", "revocation", and "trusted" folders. Move the client certificate in the "rejected" folder to the "trusted" folder and run the example again.

Maven
--------

Snapshots are available from the Sonatype repository:
```xml
